Challanges Faced:
The biggest and possibly only challenge I faced would have to be fixing the v1+json version issue with Docker and SageMaker considering that this took up most of my time and I was still unable to get it fixed possibly due to lack of understanding of how it works in the first place.
As for the cost of running a model on AWS SageMaker, the estimated cost of around $0.11/hr due to having to use ml.m5.large at one point, as for ml.t2.medium I was unable to check the running cost for this.
